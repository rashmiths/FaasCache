# FaasCache

We as a team implemented the greedy dual chaching policy suggested in the paper using cpp objects, creating a simulated object/function/variable of all the factors mentioned in the paper, we did the same thing with Time To live Policy, LRY Policy and we established comparison between all 3 and we inferred that results of our simulation are innine with whatever the authors found.

## code
This folder constitutes of the entire simulation code which makes up the frontend the processing of request the deliver of container based on gdsc,ttl,lru policy additionally also includes the code compile all results

### experiment
Experiment folder includes files that implement greedy dual policy,time to live policy,Least recently used policy. The policies are briefly discussed in the report

### plot
This folder includes the code that corresponds to plotting the result graph which helps us to compare all the policy together.

### simulation
This folder constitutes the frontend of the simulator,basically its responsible for taking input from the user and contacting the code folder.

## results

The folder contains screenshots of the plots we generated and results of how the policies work
